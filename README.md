6. Reflections: 
7. Next Steps:

// logic is there are 2 variables to match: guessed letter, to be matched with the word selected from the word bank, selectedWord
// guessed letter --> (whatever is inside a button) --> if correct, push it inside an array
// do a function which checks if the word contains the guessed letter. use includes() and if. if it is inside, push guessed letter into guessed letters array.
// then need a function, replace whatever is inside the current word with the correct letter + "_"
// loop thru the selectedWord one by one, update display if the letter in the selected word is in 

// picture that changes --> replace picture
// random

// q
- why let vs const
- why create button in HTML directly
- why p vs div
- why have image container and image 
- why the css order
- understand css line by line
- when innerHTML when textContent
- why win here lose there
- push, includes
- if + else if vs if + else
- for --> when is it triggered

// problem: 
- Attempts keep increasing

// mistakes:
- gameMessage vs gameMessage.textContent
- global vs local var --> why it doesnt work. key pt is when u need to reset. global variable --> sometimes perlu reset everytime
- toLowerCase() --> A /= a

// future:
- how to adjust the length of the word
- how to prevent double entry of the same letter
